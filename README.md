## Flower Prediction - Machine Learning Classification Project

### Overview
This machine learning project focuses on predicting the species of flowers based on their physical characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The dataset used is the **Iris dataset**, which contains data for three flower species: *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, and *Iris-virginica*. The goal of this project is to train a classification model to accurately predict the species of a flower given its attributes.

### Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the dataset to ensure it is ready for machine learning models.
- **Model Building**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest to classify the flowers.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Features
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset, visualizing the features, and identifying trends in the data.
- **Classification Algorithms**: Utilization of several popular classifiers to compare results and choose the best-performing model.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displaying evaluation metrics and generating a confusion matrix to measure accuracy and the model's classification performance.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization

### Setup & Installation
